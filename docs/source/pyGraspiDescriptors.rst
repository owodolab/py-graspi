For two-phase morphology, current **py-graspi** computes the following descriptors:
We refer to graph-centric terms defined in basic definitions section.

2. Construct set of edges, :math:`I=\{e=(u,v)\in E\;|\; (L_e(e)=f)\;\land\; ( L(u)=BLACK \land L(v)=WHITE\}`.

**DISS_f10_D**

``DISS_f10_D`` - fraction of black vertices in 10 distance to interface

This descriptor is constructed in three steps. First, we construct the subgraph
induced by a set of BLACK and GREEN vertices. Next, using Dijkstra's algorithm
the shortest paths between GREEN vertex and all other vertices in the induced
subgraph are determined. The distance is weighted by the physics-informed function
(here: :math:`f(d)=exp(-d/L_d)`, where :math:`L_d` is the exciton diffusion length).
Formally:

1. Input: Given labeled, weighted, undirected graph :math:`G=(V,E,W,L)`.
2. Construct vertex-induced subgraph, :math:`G'=(V',E')``, where: :math:`V'`` is a
   set of all BLACK and GREEN vertices in :math:`V`, :math:`E'` is a set of all
   edges between vertices in :math:`V'``.
3. Find all shortest paths in :math:`G'` from GREEN vertex :math:`u' :math:`(L(u) = GREEN)`.
4. Identify vertex set :math:`V_d=\{v \in V'\;|\;` (shortest_path(:math:`v`) :math:`<d`) :math:`\land (L(v) = BLACK)\}`.
   Shortest_path (:math:`v`) denotes the distance between :math:`u` and :math:`v` in :math:`G'``.
5. Weight each distance :math:`d` with the weighting function (:math:`f(d)=exp(-d/L_d)`).
6. Output: :math:`\sum_{i=1..|B|} f(d)i)/|B|``, where :math:`|B|` is the cardinality of a set that consists of BLACK vertices.


**CT_f_e_conn**

``CT_f_e_conn`` - fraction of interface with complementary paths to bottom and top

We search for interface edges in the graph that connect BLACK and WHITE vertices (interface),
where both vertices have paths to relevant electrodes (BLACK vertex has path to
RED meta-vertex and WHITE vertex has path to BLUE meta-vertex). Formally,

* Let :math:`G_B` be the vertex-induced subgraph with BLACK and RED vertices.
* Let :math:`G_W` be the vertex-induced subgraph with WHITE and BLUE vertices.
* Find a set :math:`I_c\subset I` of interface edges in the graph, such that the
  path from the BLACK vertex to RED exists in :math:`G_B` and the path from WHITE
  vertex to BLUE exists in :math:`G_W`.


This is computed using the following algorithm:

1. Input: Given labeled, weighted, undirected graph, :math:`G=(V,E,W,L)`.
2. Construct a filtered graph, :math:`G'=(V,E')``, where  :math:`E'`` is a set
   of edges connecting vertices of the same color.
3. Let :math:`I` be the set of all interface edges.
4. Identify connected components, :math:`C`, in :math:`G'`.
5. Compute subset :math:`R_r \subset C` of all components :math:`c\in C`,
   such that :math:`c` has BLACK vertices adjacent to RED in :math:`G` (from ``CT_f_conn_D_An``).
6. Compute subset :math:`R_b \subset C` of all components :math:`c\in C`, such
   that :math:`c` has WHITE vertices adjacent to BLUE in :math:`G` (from ``CT_f_conn_A_Ca``).
7. Identify subset, :math:`I_{rb} \subset I` where BLACK vertex belongs to
   set of vertices in :math:`R_r` and WHITE vertex belongs to set of vertices
   in :math:`R_b`.
8. Output: :math:`|I_{rb}|/|I|`.

This descriptor is formulated in a hierarchical way using ``CT_f_conn_D_An``
and ``CT_f_conn_A_Ca``. This hierarchical construction is one additional
advantage of our graph-based approach. Moreover, the next descriptor is
computed using intermediate data from this descriptor.
