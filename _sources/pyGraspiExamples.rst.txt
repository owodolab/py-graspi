Example of Usage
==============================================

Getting Started
===========================

**Testing Py-Graspi Online**

Follow these steps to explore the capabilities of Py-Graspi using an online Jupyter Notebook environment like Google Colab.

**To run an existing test notebook**

1. Open Google Colab.
2. Click the GitHub tab, and paste the following link: https://github.com/owodolab/py-graspi/blob/dev/tests/pip_install_descriptors_example.ipynb
3. Since this is an existing notebook, you can run each code block to view the output.

**To create your own notebook and use the Py-GraSPI package**

1. Open Google Colab.
2. In the notebook, install Py-Graspi by running the following command:
.. code-block:: bash

    !pip install py-graspi

3. Import the py-graspi package by running this command in the notebook:

.. code-block:: bash

    import py_graspi as ig

Get the List of Descriptors
===========================

A **descriptor stored in a dictionary** can be found by calling the function descriptors(graph)

.. code-block:: bash

    ig.descriptors(g)      # g is a graph object

A **list of descriptors** in a **text file** can be found by calling the function descriptorsToTxt(dictionary,filename)

.. code-block:: bash

    ig.descriptorsToTxt(dict,"descriptors_list.txt")

Visualize Graphs
================

For 2D graphs, call visual2D(graph)

.. code-block:: bash

    g = ig.generateGraph("2D-testFile/testFile-10-2D.txt")     # utilizing the test file found in 2D-testFiles folder as an example
    ig.visual2D(g)

For 3D graphs, call visual3D(graph)

.. code-block:: bash

    g = ig.generateGraph("3D-testFile/testFile-10-3D.txt")     # utilizing the test file found in 2D-testFiles folder as an example
    ig.visual3D(g)
