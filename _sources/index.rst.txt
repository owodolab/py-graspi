Py-GraSPI Documentation
========================

Welcome to the documentation for **Py-GraSPI**.


About
------------

**Py-GraSPI** (Graph-based Structure Property Identifier) is a Python package designed to compute a comprehensive set of
descriptors for segmented microstructures using a graph-based approach. It leverages the **igraph** library to represent microstructures
as graphs, enabling efficient computation of a wide range of descriptors with low computational overhead. Py-GraSPI is the Python
implementation of the original **GraSPI package**, which was developed in C/C++. In addition to descriptor computation,
Py-GraSPI offers tools for data conversion across various formats and for post-processing the raw outputs of the graph analysis.



In Brief
------------
The Py-Graspi project provides tools for creating, filtering, and analyzing graphs, with benchmarks for runtime and memory performance.
